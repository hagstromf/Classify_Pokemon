# Classify Starter Pokemon

This is a project I did for fun as a quick demo of my skills.  
  
The goal of this project is to train a CNN with Keras to classify images of the first generation starter pokemons and their evolutions. The data used in this project is from a set of labeled pokemon images collected by Lance Zhang [7000 Labeled Pokemon](https://www.kaggle.com/lantian773030/pokemonclassification).
