# Classify Starter Pokemon

This is a quick project I did for fun to practice implementing Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras.  
  
The goal of this project is to train a CNN to classify images of the first generation starter pokemons and their evolutions. The data used in this project is from a set of labeled pokemon images collected by Lance Zhang [7000 Labeled Pokemon](https://www.kaggle.com/lantian773030/pokemonclassification).
